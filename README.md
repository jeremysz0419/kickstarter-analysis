# kickstarter-analysis
This analysis was performed for helping our client Louise understand trends towards a successful play based on historical data we have for kickstarter projects/shows. Per her request, we performed several analysis on how different campaigns' success, failure, and cancellation rates varied based on their launch dates and funding goals. Please see below for our findings, analysis, and suggestions to future approaches.
