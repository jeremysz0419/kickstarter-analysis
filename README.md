# kickstarter-analysis
This project is an analysis performed based on data given on the history of successful, failed, cancelled, and live shows. Our objective was to discover trends that indicated failures and successes based on the amount of pledges and goals the project has received. We have performed pivot table analysis as well as discovered standard deviations regarding the pledged/goals of our data to determine the optimal funding asked to have a successful kickstarter project. 

##Louise' Analysis 
Based on our findings for plays within the UK, the trend seemed to show that projects asking for a mean of $4000 pledge amount fell into the average of most successfull kickstarters.
